				</a> says, "Gather data primarily through Face-to-face communication, not online surveys." The discussion is the most valuable part of this exercise. In my experience, you can easily spend an hour on each question. That's a lot of time. Doing the survey before the workshop can help you prioritize the topics you want to discuss (e.g., spend more time on the ones with lower score). Keep in mind that just doing the survey is not enough. You need to spend time talking to the team.`,
